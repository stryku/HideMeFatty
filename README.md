## Before hide-and-seek
<pre>
There are some things you must to know before using this program.
First of all you must run it with root permissions.
After hidding some files you can view/copy etc. files on partition (more about that below) but you can't modify/remove them because you will lose hidded files.
</pre>

## Usage
### General info
<pre>
Program will ask you for four things.
1. Files to hide - paths to files you want to hide.
2. Files on partition - FULL paths to files on partition after what you want to hide your files.
3. Path to partition - FULL path to partition. On most linux it is that in /media folder.
4. Path to partition device file - FULL path to partition device file. That on /dev folder.
